# Creating a Free Tier Amazon RDS DB Instance

This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a free tier Amazon RDS DB instance.

## Step 1: Open the Amazon RDS Console

Start by opening the Amazon RDS console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/).

## Step 2: Create a new RDS DB instance

In the navigation pane, choose "Databases", and then choose "Create database".

## Step 3: Select the engine

In the "Create database" page, choose "Standard Create". For "Engine options", select the database engine that you want to use. For this tutorial, we'll use MySQL.

## Step 4: Choose the DB instance size

For "Templates", choose "Free tier". This will automatically select the settings that fit within the free tier limits.

## Step 5: Specify DB details

Enter a name for the DB instance in the "DB instance identifier" field. For "Master username", enter a username. This is the username that you'll use to connect to the database.

For "Master password", enter a password, and then enter it again in the "Confirm password" field. This is the password that you'll use, along with the master username, to connect to the database.

## Step 6: Configure Security Group

In the "Connectivity" section, you'll find the "Additional connectivity configuration". Here, click on the "Default VPC security groups" link. This will take you to the VPC Dashboard.

In the VPC Dashboard, select the security group associated with your RDS instance. In the "Inbound rules" section, click on "Edit inbound rules".

Click on "Add rule". For "Type", select "MYSQL/Aurora". This will automatically set the port range to 3306. For "Source", select "My IP" to automatically fill in your IP address. Click on "Save rules" to save the changes.

This step ensures that your IP is allowed to communicate with the RDS instance on the MySQL port 3306.

## Step 6: Configure advanced settings

In the "Connectivity" section, choose the VPC where you want to create the DB instance. For "Publicly accessible", choose "Yes" if you want to connect to the DB instance from outside the VPC. Otherwise, choose "No".

In the "Database options" section, enter a name for the initial database in the "Initial database name" field.

## Step 7: Create the DB instance

Choose "Create database" to create the DB instance. It might take a few minutes for the DB instance to be created. You can check the status of the DB instance in the RDS console.

Once the DB instance is available, you can connect to the database using the endpoint and port number displayed in the RDS console.

# Installing and Using MySQL on Windows

This guide will walk you through the process of installing and using MySQL on Windows.

## Step 1: Download MySQL Installer

Go to the MySQL Community Downloads page at [https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/).

Download the MySQL Installer for Windows.

## Step 2: Install MySQL

Run the MySQL Installer that you downloaded. 

During the setup process, you'll be asked to choose a setup type. You can select "Developer Default" to install MySQL server and other MySQL tools related to MySQL development, or "Server only" to install just the MySQL server.

## Step 3: Configure MySQL

After the installation, the MySQL Installer will initiate the configuration process. 

You'll be asked to choose a configuration type. You can select "Development Machine" for development purposes.

You'll also be asked to set a root password, which you'll use to connect to the MySQL server. Make sure to remember this password.

## Step 4: Connect to MySQL

After the configuration, you can connect to the MySQL server using the MySQL Command Line Client. You'll be asked to enter the root password that you set during the configuration process.

After entering the password, you should be connected to the MySQL server and able to run SQL commands.

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

# Installing pip on Windows
